"""
Task 6: Final Recommendation

I recommend the RidgeClassifier model for this churn prediction task, as it
achieved the highest Mean F1-score (~0.345) during cross-validation. While the 
"Most-frequent Dummy" shows a higher accuracy (83.75%), it is a useless baseline
that fails to identify any churning customers (Recall = 0); this highlights why
accuracy is a misleading metric for imbalanced datasets where missing a churner is
costly. The recommended model successfully captures churners with a Recall of
~0.64, significantly outperforming the "Stratified Dummy" (random guessing), which 
only achieved an F1-score of 0.16. Although there is a trade-off where precision is
lower (~0.23) due to the balanced class weights, the model provides a meaningful 
signal that is twice as effective as random chance. The final evaluation on the held-out
test set (F1: 0.381) confirms that the model generalizes well and performs 
consistently with our cross-validation estimates.
